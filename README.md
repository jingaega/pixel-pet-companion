# Pixel Pet Companion (Flutter, modular, offline-only)

An experimental tiny pixel pet you can feed, pet, play with, and put to sleep. 

## 🚀 Highlights
- Modular **feature-first** foldering: `core/`, `features/pet/`, `theme/`
- `PetController` with Provider (`ChangeNotifier`) for state
- `LocalStore` for persistence, `TickerService` for time-based updates
- Pixel sprite built with `CustomPaint` — **no image assets**
- Clear separation of **model / state / view / widgets**

## 🛠️ Run
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
or use emulator
